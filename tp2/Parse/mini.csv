ABSTRACT Designing three-dimensional (3D) surfaces is difficult in both the physical world  and in 3D modeling software, requiring background knowledge and skill. The goal of this  work is to make 3D surface design easier and more accessible through natural and  .."

A Kulshreshth, C Zorn, JJ LaViola - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI),  , 2013 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT Hand gestures are intuitive ways to interact with a variety of user interfaces. We  developed a real-time finger tracking technique using the Microsoft Kinect as an input device  and compared its results with an existing technique that uses the K-curvature algorithm.  .."
